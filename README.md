# Asteroid Impact Response Latency
A repository for building an Arduino to test [Asterioid Impact](https://github.com/richardhuskey/asteroid_impact) response time latency on different computer hardware.

This code is currently in development. Stay tuned!

Example command line input to run a test:

```$ python2.7 game.py --effects-volume 1 --music-volume 0 --display-mode fullscreen --script-json test_final_audio.json --log-overwrite false --reaction-log-filename rt_audio_py2_ubuntu.csv```
